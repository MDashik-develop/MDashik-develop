As an energetic and results-driven Full-Stack Developer, I am passionate about building modern and user-friendly web applications. My core expertise lies in developing robust back-ends with PHP, Laravel, and MySQL, and crafting engaging and responsive front-ends using React, Livewire, and Gsap.

Since 2021, I have successfully completed a diverse range of projects as a freelancer. These include e-commerce platforms, captivating landing pages, professional portfolios, travel & tourism websites, news portals, and courier service applications. In these projects, I handled both design and development to help clients elevate their businesses to new heights.

Additionally, my experience as a Full-Stack Developer at Vida Technology has further honed my skills in teamwork and managing large-scale projects.

I am always ready to take on new challenges and am prepared to contribute my skills to help an organization succeed.
